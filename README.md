<p align="center"><strong>AmicoScript local audio transcription tool.</strong></p>

**AmicoScript** is a privacy-focused, local-first transcription tool built on OpenAI's Whisper models. It allows you to transform audio recordings into structured, searchable transcripts without your data ever leaving your repository or machine. Whether you need speaker identification (diarization), translation, or simple subtitles, AmicoScript provides a fast, free, and secure alternative to cloud services.

## ✨ Why AmicoScript

Most transcription tools:

- require uploading your audio to the cloud
- cost money or have limits
- don’t give you control over your data

AmicoScript keeps everything local.

→ Your audio never leaves your machine.
