## [Unreleased]

- Fixed PyInstaller packaging for speaker diarization by bundling `pyannote.audio` data files (including `telemetry/config.yaml`) in standalone builds.
- Fixed windowed (`--noconsole`) runtime crash during diarization (`'NoneType' object has no attribute 'write'`) by providing safe stdio fallbacks for libraries that write to `stdout`/`stderr`.
- Improved standalone release reliability notes for packaging and rebuild workflows.
